How to Use FileHashler
----------------------

FileHashler is a Java program and requires JRE 1.8.0 or higher installed on your computer. This release works only as commandline program. It can be operated in pure console mode, i.e. on a headless Java VM, and in graphical support modus. Support modus is assumed the default if the VM allows it, and brings some comfort benefit through passphrase input dialogs. For pure console mode in a GUI capable VM you have to apply option "+i" on the commandline.

Place the "fhl.jar" file into some directory D. Bring up a console or a console window and start with "java -jar <path-of-D>/fhl.jar <commandline>" to start the program. A help text should be displayed. A help document can be created by applying "-h <filename>" as commandline argument. Read this document for command details and general information.
