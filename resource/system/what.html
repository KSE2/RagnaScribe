<h3>What is Ragna Scribe?</h3>

<i>Ragna Scribe</i> is a multi-dimensional text editor for documents with tree-order of their articles.
Documents own a tree-ordered outline (content table) and feature a separately editable text article for each tree-node.
Currently we realise the commonly known plain-text file format "<i>Treepad</i>".

<p>Multiple documents can be open in the editor at the same time. Via the clipboard
articles and text can be exchanged between documents. 
Undo/Redo and automatised safety storage guarantee a high standard in comfort and data security. 
Text-files can be held encrypted. For this purpose we use algorithm Twofish in mode CBC with a random generated key.
