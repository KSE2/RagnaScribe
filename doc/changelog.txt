CHANGELOG 

*** Release V 1-2-1 ***, 05 May 2024
Changes since version 1-2-0

NEW FEATURES:
Discovered weaknessses in the underlying encryption tools have been
removed. Entropy of random number generation is increased, which improves
quality and security of encryption. Note: Encrypted files stored with this
version cannot be opened in previous versions (new encrypted file format).

*** Release V 1-2-0 ***, 26 March 2024
Changes since version 1-1-0

NEW FEATURES:
Text search is implemented which offers different modes 
(case sensitivity, whole words) and 3 scopes of investigation.
The result is a list of find-positions which allows to move to the
text locations quickly. CTRL-F activates the search function.
The library for file encryption is upgraded and offers enhanced
randomness (entropy) for internal value generations, resulting in
enhanced security.

BUG FIXES: 
Corrected an error condition for file paths larger than length 80, which
rendered the document disabled for IO operation.
Some shortcut keys (menu) have be reassigned to new codes as they 
conflicted with shortcuts of the text editor.

*** Release V 1-1-0 ***, 04. Jan. 2024
Changes since version 1-0-0

BUG FIXES: 
-- Corrected malfunctioning of saving and loading files under Java versions
above 8 (JAXB exceptions). 
-- Corrected erroneous appearance of German menu texts in JVM with default 
charset different to UTF-8. 
-- Applied internationalisation for undo/redo texts. 
-- Selected article is now correctly memorised over sessions.
-- The behaviour of file history storage has been greatly enhanced and
renders more accurate time-slot service.
-- accidential feature storage failure in copied articles has been corrected
    
NEW FEATURES:
-- New option in global preferences to set feature 'linewrap' in text editor
(boolean) by default. New articles assume value 'true' if this option is set,
otherwise they assume the value of their predecessor in the document.
-- Improvements in Document Toolbox: a new UUID can be assigned for the 
document via button. Security and mechanism of "Reload" function improved.
Modifications in the toolbox are now reversible by leaving the dialog via
"Cancel" button. 
-- The "mirror saved" message (status-line) has been transformed into a light 
phenomenon of the status bar's activity box. 
-- Documents and articles can be duplicated by menu commands. 
-- Passwords of open encrypted files are automatically attempted when opening
files from the previous session list.
